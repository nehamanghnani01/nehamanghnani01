üî≠ Current Work 
- 
### AI for Software Security and User Privacy
#### Masking User Sensitive Data 
- Extensive use of GenAI websites makes user private information less secure as it is retained by websites or used by models for training
- Developing a system to mask sensitive data from the user input before it is prompted to the model
- Extracting private information locally, and preserving the values until response is received to the user in the local device
- Ensuring user private information is preserved locally and not sent out to the website or any large language model used via user prompts.
- Currently, evaluating different model performances in the local environment for accuracy of identifying sensitive information. 
#### Capturing API Endpoints 
- Developing a chrome extension which captures API endpoints (HTTP requests)
- Analyzing the user sensitive information which is passed via the API endpoints
- Aim - to use local LLM to parse the user information being passed and sanitize the data before sending it via the API to the website
- Exploring the usage of [ollama](https://github.com/ollama) and [ollama.js](https://github.com/ollama/ollama-js) to analyze request payloads
  
### Participated in the AIXCC DARPA Challenge 2024-2025

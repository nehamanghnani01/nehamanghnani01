üî≠ Work Highlights
- 
### AI for Software Security and User Privacy, Sept 2023 - Mar 2025
_Worked as Student Technician - assisting PhD candidate with Software Engineering workload_

#### Masking User Sensitive Data 
- Extensive use of GenAI websites makes user private information less secure as it is retained by websites or used by models for training
- Built Chrome Extension to mask sensitive data when interacting with websites & remote models, enhancing privacy.
- Extracting private information and preserving in key-value format until response is received to the user in the local device
- Ensuring user private information is preserved locally and not sent out to the website or any large language model used via user prompts.
- Currently, implemeting Python scripts to evaluate model performance for on-device deployment, ensuring best LLM selection.
  
#### Capturing API Endpoints 
- Developing a chrome extension which captures API endpoints (HTTP requests)
- Analyzing the user sensitive information which is passed via the API endpoints
- Configured an Express.js backend to route local LLM traffic, resolving CORS policy restrictions for seamless integration.
- Aim - to use local LLM to parse the user information being passed and sanitize the data before sending it via the API to the website
- Exploring the usage of [ollama](https://github.com/ollama) and [ollama.js](https://github.com/ollama/ollama-js) to analyze request payloads
  
### Participated in the AIXCC DARPA Challenge 2024-2025
- Identifying Code Vulnerabilities and Security Issues using LLM's
- Developing an automated AI system to find code vulnerabilities and provide code patches using LLM (GPT4 / GPT4o)
  
üèÜ _[Semifinal Results](https://aicyberchallenge.com/) (August 11 2024) - One of the Top 7 teams (Team name - 'all_you_need_is_a_fuzzing_brain') proceeding to Finals, which is to be held in August 2025_

### Journey from Scratch to Production - BlueSecures Android Platform, Oct 2020 - Jul 2023 
- Founding Software Engineer for the B2B SaaS product BlueSecures for secure and private official messaging.
- Incorporated MVVM architecture, shifted codebase from Java to Kotlin, to enhance stability and easy code maintenance.
- Code refactors and efficient root cause analysis to reduce recurring code bugs by 70%.
- Involved in end-to-end development of business features and collaborated with cross functional teams to deliver the product on time.
- Promoted to Senior Software Engineer, and led a team of 5 engineers through the bi-weekly sprints ensuring timely feature delivery.
